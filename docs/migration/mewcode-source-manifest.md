# MewCode Source Migration Manifest

The user confirmed authority to copy and modify the local MewCode snapshot.

Git commits cannot embed their own final SHA. Each package entry records the
unique Lore intent line of its migration commit; resolve the SHA with
`git log --format="%H %s" --grep="<intent line>"`.

## Packages

### conversation

- Source: `internal/conversation`
- Target: `internal/runtime/conversation`
- Source files:
  - `conversation.go`: `9FC69554F3B713D3B57EB987D768AC229FF1BCFE3C999A04B71A35838BB36958`
- Fusion changes:
  - Move the package under the Devflow runtime boundary.
  - Replace the injected `mewcodeMd` identity heading with `devflowMd`.
  - Add focused regression tests for deep isolation and protocol behavior across caller-owned inputs, `GetMessages` outputs, Anthropic serialization, and OpenAI serialization.
  - Replace the narrow JSON-like copy path with a reflective deep-copy guard that preserves concrete map/slice types and nil values while keeping external mutations from polluting stored history.
- Windows changes: none required; the package uses platform-neutral Go APIs.
- Verification: `gofmt -w internal/runtime/conversation/conversation.go internal/runtime/conversation/conversation_test.go`; `go test ./internal/runtime/conversation -count=1`; `go test ./... -count=1`; `go vet ./...`; `git diff --check`
- Lore intent: `Preserve conversation semantics inside the Devflow runtime`

### hooks

- Source: `internal/hooks`
- Target: `internal/runtime/hooks`
- Source files:
  - `hooks.go`: `C7127D660853A1C0DC0223FFEB9460FCACDAF684B312AE3A23B8237FF5FA097B`
  - `hooks_test.go`: `CC0436CC9226E175C0A6EEEDD6C72C32788555D8906088884BDB2BFF3B8D461B`
- Fusion changes:
  - Move the package under the Devflow runtime boundary without changing the hook engine API.
  - Split shell process creation into OS-specific `command_windows.go` and `command_unix.go` helpers so tests can verify the selected host shell directly.
  - Export `DEVFLOW_EVENT`, `DEVFLOW_TOOL`, and `DEVFLOW_FILE_PATH` while preserving the `MEWCODE_*` aliases for migration compatibility.
  - Adapt the migrated tests with build-tag helpers so command, timeout, and env assertions are reliable on native Windows instead of depending on Git Bash semantics.
  - Normalize hook glob comparisons to slash-separated paths so the same pattern matches both `src/foo.go` and `src\foo.go`.
  - Clone async hook `HookContext` values, including JSON-like nested `ToolArgs`, so caller mutations after `RunHooks` do not leak into background actions.
- Windows changes:
  - Use `powershell.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -NonInteractive -Command` for hook commands on supported Windows hosts.
  - Reject any implicit Git Bash dependency; Unix-like targets prefer `bash -c` when Bash is installed and fall back to POSIX `sh -c` when it is not.
- Remaining limitations:
  - Detached descendants are outside the current hook timeout guarantee on both Windows and Unix-like hosts.
- Verification: `gofmt -w internal/runtime/hooks/*.go`; `go test ./internal/runtime/hooks -count=1 -timeout 2m`; `GOOS=linux go test -c ./internal/runtime/hooks -o <temp binary>`; `go test ./... -count=1 -timeout 2m`; `go vet ./...`; `git diff --check`
- Lore intent: `Make runtime hooks executable on the supported Windows host`
